# 🧠 NFT Liquidation Flash Loan Bot

An advanced flash loan-based bot that exploits NFT lending platforms like BendDAO, JPEG’d, and Paraspace by monitoring mismatches between real-time floor prices and on-chain oracles — and automatically liquidates under-collateralized NFT loans for profit.

---

## 🚀 Overview

NFT lending protocols use delayed oracles for floor prices. This creates profitable windows during price crashes. This bot:

- Scans high-risk loans
- Compares off-chain floor prices with oracle-based values
- Executes instant flash loans to liquidate NFT collateral
- Sells the NFT at market price and profits from the spread

All executed in a single atomic transaction. No upfront capital required.

## ⚙️ Flash Loan Strategy

1. **Monitor NFT lending platforms**  
   Detect NFT loans at risk of liquidation.

2. **Fetch real-time floor prices**  
   Use Blur/LooksRare APIs for instant price checks.

3. **Execute flash loan**  
   Borrow ETH to buy out the under-collateralized loan.

4. **Liquidate & sell NFT**  
   Instantly sell the collateral on the open market.

5. **Repay loan & profit**  
   Return flash loan and keep the liquidation bonus & spread.

🤖 Running the Bot

node scripts/runBot.js

This script:

Connects to NFT lending pools

Scans risky NFT loans

Executes liquidation logic when price misalignment is detected


You can automate this with a scheduler (e.g., cron) and route transactions via Flashbots Protect.

🛡 Security Tips

Use Flashbots to avoid front-running

Obfuscate contract logic where necessary

Do not hardcode private keys — use .env

Monitor gas usage and transaction slippage
